This is a program features multiple sensors that inherit from the Parent Sensor Class. The Sensor class has the attributes; (1) type for the type of sensor a sensor is, (2) unit for the unit number or the identification number of a specific sensor, (3) current reading for the current reading of a specific sensor. Our team created a subclass sensor of Proximity Sensor, Soil Sensor, Color Sensor, and _________. Thus, the current reading can be distance(centimeter), moisture level(%), color(r/g/b), and _____(_____). You can display details of each sensors using the method display_details() which is an abstract method of the Parent class.
